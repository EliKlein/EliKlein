Hey. I like video games. I like coding. I like baking. I also like words (as in, stuff vaguely qualified as linguistics).

I currently like to use Python more than any other language, but I've learned about how coding works at all different levels, at least to some extent.

If you're reading this then you probably already know how to reach me; however, if that's not the case, I suggest looking at my [personal website](https://eliklein.github.io/PersonalWebsite/) (which is hosted on GitHub).

I'm working on a Unity project. This is partially to learn and improve with the Visual Scripting plug-in (you might know it as Bolt). It's also partially to learn and improve with C#. The last reason is really a lot of things that boil down to "I want to make a video game."
