Hey. I like video games. I like coding. I like baking.

I like to use Python for the most part, but I've learned about how coding works at all different levels, at least to some extent.

If you're reading this then you probably already know how to reach me. This is not to say that I *want* to make that assumption-- I just would rather direct you to my [personal website](https://eliklein.github.io/PersonalWebsite/) (which is hosted on GitHub) if you need to know how to contact me (rather than try to remember what personal information I've decided is OK to post online).

(-last updated Aug 25 2021-) I'm currently learning how to script things in Unity. This includes "Visual Scripting" and C#.
